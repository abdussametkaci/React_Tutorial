## Create React App
The create-react-app tool is an officially supported way to create React applications.

Node.js is required to use create-react-app.

Open your terminal in the directory you would like to create your application.

Run this command to create a React application named my-react-app:
```
npx create-react-app my-react-app
```

## Run the React Application
Run this command to move to the my-react-app directory:
```
cd my-react-app
```
Run this command to execute the React application my-react-app:
```
npm start
```
A new browser window will pop up with your newly created React App! If not, open your browser and type [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the address bar.

## What is React?
React, sometimes referred to as a frontend JavaScript framework, is a JavaScript library created by Facebook.

React is a tool for building UI components.

## How does React Work?
```
React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory.
```

Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.

```
React only changes what needs to be changed!
```

React finds out what changes have been made, and changes **only** what needs to be changed.

You will learn the various aspects of how React does this in the rest of this tutorial.
