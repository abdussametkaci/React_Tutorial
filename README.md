## Create React App
The create-react-app tool is an officially supported way to create React applications.

Node.js is required to use create-react-app.

Open your terminal in the directory you would like to create your application.

Run this command to create a React application named my-react-app:
```
npx create-react-app my-react-app
```

## Run the React Application
Run this command to move to the my-react-app directory:
```
cd my-react-app
```
Run this command to execute the React application my-react-app:
```
npm start
```
A new browser window will pop up with your newly created React App! If not, open your browser and type [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in the address bar.
